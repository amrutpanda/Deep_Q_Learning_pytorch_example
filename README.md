# Deep_Q_Learning_pytorch_example
Simple DQN example using Pytorch (Covert tensorflow version from this [Github Page](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/tree/master/contents/5_Deep_Q_Network)).

## Implementation ##
- Natural Deep Q learning
- Deep Q learning with Prioritized Experience Replay
- Double Deep Q learning
- Dueling Deep Q learning

The above implementations are integrated together, which can be selected in the initialization of DQN network.

## Prerequisites ##
- Python 2.7
- Pytorch 0.4.1

## Usage ##
- Download the three .py files 
- Run 'run_this.py' and see the result of Deep Reinforcement learning in small game.
